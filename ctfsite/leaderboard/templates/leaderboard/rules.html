            <li>Form teams of 2-4 people.</li>
            <li>The winner is the team to reach the highest level the fastest.</li>
            <li>The winner is expected to be able to explain the solution of all levels.</li>
            <li>Each level implies a lesson to learn in software security. Try to identify what it is!</li>
            <li>Hints will be released daily.</li>
            <li>There are no trick questions. The key to the next level is always about the vulnerable code,
              not something else, and not the environment, or this leaderboard.</li>
