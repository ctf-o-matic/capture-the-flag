              <ul>
                <li>Team members cannot change after the team has passed <code>level0</code>.</li>
                <li>The winner is the team to reach the highest level the fastest.</li>
                <li>The winner must be able to explain the solution of all levels, or else forfeit victory.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Each level implies a lesson to learn in software security. Try to identify what it is!</li>
            <li>Hints will be released daily.</li>
            <li>There are no trick questions. The key to the next level is always about the vulnerable code of that level.
