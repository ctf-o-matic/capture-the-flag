            The hardest part of writing secure code is learning to think like an attacker.
            For example, every programmer is told to watch out for SQL injections,
            but it's hard to appreciate just how exploitable they are until you've written a SQL injection of your own.
          </p>

          <p class="text-grey">
            We built <em>Capture The Flag</em>, a security wargame inspired by SmashTheStack's IO,
            to help our teams practice identifying and exploiting common security problems.
            After completing this <em>CTF</em>,
            you should have a greatly improved understanding of how attackers will try to break your code.
            We also hope you will have fun in the process!
          </p>

          <p class="text-grey">
            You can begin the CTF challenge by running <code>ssh -p 8022 level0@34.66.129.228</code> from your shell.

            Your goal is to read the contents of <code>/home/level1/.password</code>.
            In <code>/levels/level1</code>, you'll find a binary owned by <code>level1</code> (as well as its source code)
            â€” you will probably find it useful.
            Once you have the password, you can <code>ssh</code> in as <code>level1</code>,
            where new instructions await you.
