Capture The Flag!
=================

Package security wargames for easy replay in an isolated environment.

A security wargame is ... TODO

The aim of this repository is to make it easy to setup an isolated environment where you can play again the levels of a security wargame.

At the moment there is only one instance of such security wargame, [Stripe's first Capture The Flag][stripe1-blog], packaged as an ISO image. It can be easily loaded in a virtualization software such as VirtualBox. See [`stripe1/`](stripe1) for details.

I'm currently working on packaging the content of the Stripe wargame as a Docker image.
