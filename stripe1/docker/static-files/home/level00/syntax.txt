Hi there!

If you know what to do but have a bit of struggle with the
syntax, you may find these examples helpful.

Example 1: send an HTTP GET to a local web server and output the result

    curl localhost:1234

Example 2: passing binary data as command line arguments

    /path/to/program arg1 $(printf "\x41\x00\x20\x41") arg2

Example 3: view binary data in hexadecimal format

    printf "\x41\x00\x20\x41" | hexdump

Example 4: send an HTTP POST with the POST data in a file, and at
the same time set a cookie

    curl localhost:1234 --data-urlencode @postdata.txt --cookie name=value

Example 5: repeat something a 100 times

    for i in $(seq 1 100); do echo hello $i; done

Good luck, and have fun!
