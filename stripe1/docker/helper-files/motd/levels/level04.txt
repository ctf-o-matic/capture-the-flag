Congratulations on making it to level 4! You're almost done!

The password for the next (and final) level is in: /home/level05/.password

As it turns out, level05 is running a public uppercasing service. You
 can POST data to it, and it'll uppercase the data for you:

  curl localhost:8005 -d 'hello friend'
  {
      "processing_time": 5.0067901611328125e-06,
      "queue_time": 0.41274619102478027,
      "result": "HELLO FRIEND"
  }

You can view the source for this service in /levels/level05. As you
can see, the service is structured as a queue server and a queue
worker.

Could it be that this seemingly innocuous service will be level05's
downfall?
