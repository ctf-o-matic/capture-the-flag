Congratulations on making it to level 4! You're getting close!

The password for the flag is in /home/level05/.password.

As it turns out, level05 is a pretty arrogant user. He created a
taunting utility and left it in the directory /levels/level05
This utility will read the first line of a specified file, compare
it with your supplied guess, and taunt you unless you guessed correctly.

You could try using the taunt utility to brute-force the password, but
that would take... well, I don't want to say forever, but
approximately that. I guess you'll have to find another way.
