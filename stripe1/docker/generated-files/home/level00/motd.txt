Welcome to the Capture The Flag security challenge!
 
This is a security wargame inspired by Stripe.com[1]
 
In /home/level01/.password is the password of the level01 user.
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to read that
file and login as level01 to advance to the next level.
You may find the files in /levels/level01 useful.
 
There are a total of 6 levels in this challenge; your goal is
to advance level by level by discovering and exploiting the
vulnerability at each level until you reach level06, the
final level with the flag and glory!
 
Happy hacking!
The ctf-o-matic team
