Hi there!

For your convenience, we included some tools that you migth
find helpful:

* objdump   # display information from object files
* gdb       # the GNU debugger
* curl      # transfer a URL (run http GET/POST requests, etc)
* ruby      # interpreted object oriented scripting language
* python    # interpreted object oriented scripting language
* vi        # a programmer's text editor
* nano      # text editor, an enhanced free Pico clone

However, epecially at higher levels it is probably easier to
copy the source code files of the levels to your host system,
compile them as 32-bit Linux binaries, and develop the exploit
code in your comfortable environment using your favorite
tools. When an exploit code is ready, copy it to the Live CD
using scp or sftp, and login to the Live CD as execute against
the vulnerable programs. (At least that's how *we* do it...)

If you need superuser access while running the Live CD,
you can switch to the `tc` user with `su - tc` and perform
administrative tasks using `sudo`. To install additional
software use the `tce` command (with the `tc` user), this
is the package manager of Tiny Core Linux, the base system
of this Live CD.

Good luck, and have fun!
