Welcome to the Capture The Flag security challenge!
 
The password for the next level is in: /home/level01/.password
You may find the files in /levels/level01 useful.
While the supplied binary mostly just does mundane tasks, we trust
you'll find a way of making it do something much more interesting.
 
Your goal is to advance level by level by discovering and exploiting the
vulnerability at each level until you reach the final level with the flag!
 
Happy hacking!
