Welcome to the Capture The Flag security challenge!

In /home/level1/.password is the password of the level1 user.
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to read that
file and login as level1 to advance to the next level.
You may find the files in /levels/level1 useful.

Your goal is to advance from level to level by discovering and exploiting the
vulnerability at each level until you reach the final level with the flag!

Happy hacking!
The Capture The Flag Team
