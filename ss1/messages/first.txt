Welcome to the Capture The Flag security challenge!

In /home/level01/.password is the password of the level01 user.
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to read that
file and login as level01 to advance to the next level.
You may find the files in /levels/level01 useful.

Your goal is to advance from level to level by discovering and exploiting the
vulnerability at each level until you reach the final level with the flag!

Happy hacking!
