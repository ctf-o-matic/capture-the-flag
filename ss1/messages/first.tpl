Welcome to the Capture The Flag security challenge!

The users of this system are named level1, level2, level3, and so on.
Each user owns some program running in the system. Developed with love.
These programs appear to be well-protected, and in any case, harmless.

Unfortunately, appearances can be deceiving. Each of the programs have
a fatal flaw, which in the wrong hands could lead to unauthorized access
to the user account of their owners, which in turn can lead to further
escalation of privileges.

Your goal is to advance from level to level, by discovering and exploiting
vulnerabilities. On the last level, the flag (and glory!) is awaiting you!

__HINT__

Happy hacking!
